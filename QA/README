Checking the the output from phpruntests against run-tests.php
==============================================================

1) The output from running run-tests.php for each of the top-level directories is 
in the directory 'results'. For example rt_ext is the output from running all the tests under  ext.

2) Run the new run tests with flags -o csv, against each of the top level directories.

3) Cpmpare the number of failures by using:

php fail_compare.php new_run_tests_output old_run_tests_output ext

(or substitute Zend/tests/sapi for ext).
